      <h2>Scripture</h2>
      <p>Acts 2:14-15; 22-24; 29-33; 36-42; 46-47(NIV)</p>
      <section class="scripture">

        <p><b></b></p>
        <p>
            <sup>14</sup> Then Peter stood up with the Eleven, raised his voice and addressed the crowd: “Fellow Jews and all of you who live in Jerusalem, let me explain this to you; listen carefully to what I say.
        </p>
        <p>
          <sup>15</sup> These people are not drunk, as you suppose. It’s only nine in the morning!
        </p>
        <p>
          <sup>22</sup> “Fellow Israelites, listen to this: Jesus of Nazareth was a man accredited by God to you by miracles, wonders and signs, which God did among you through him, as you yourselves know.
        </p>
        <p>
          <sup>23</sup> This man was handed over to you by God’s deliberate plan and foreknowledge; and you, with the help of wicked men, put him to death by nailing him to the cross.
        </p>
        <p>
          <sup>24</sup> But God raised him from the dead, freeing him from the agony of death, because it was impossible for death to keep its hold on him.
        </p>
        <p>
          <sup>29</sup> “Fellow Israelites, I can tell you confidently that the patriarch David died and was buried, and his tomb is here to this day.
        </p>
        <p>
          <sup>30</sup> But he was a prophet and knew that God had promised him on oath that he would place one of his descendants on his throne.
        </p>
        <p>
          <sup>31</sup> Seeing what was to come, he spoke of the resurrection of the Messiah, that he was not abandoned to the realm of the dead, nor did his body see decay.
        </p>
        <p>
          <sup>32</sup> God has raised this Jesus to life, and we are all witnesses of it.
        </p>
        <p>
          <sup>33</sup> Exalted to the right hand of God, he has received from the Father the promised Holy Spirit and has poured out what you now see and hear.
        </p>
        <p>
          <sup>36</sup> “Therefore let all Israel be assured of this: God has made this Jesus, whom you crucified, both Lord and Messiah.”
        </p>
        <p>
          <sup>37</sup> When the people heard this, they were cut to the heart and said to Peter and the other apostles, “Brothers, what shall we do?”
        </p>
        <p>
          <sup>38</sup> Peter replied, “Repent and be baptized, every one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins. And you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.
        </p>
        <p>
          <sup>39</sup> The promise is for you and your children and for all who are far off—for all whom the Lord our God will call.”
        </p>
        <p>
          <sup>40</sup> With many other words he warned them; and he pleaded with them, “Save yourselves from this corrupt generation.”
        </p>
        <p>
          <sup>41</sup> Those who accepted his message were baptized, and about three thousand were added to their number that day.
        </p>
        <p>
          <sup>42</sup> They devoted themselves to the apostles’ teaching and to fellowship, to the breaking of bread and to prayer.
        </p>
        <p>
          <sup>46</sup> Every day they continued to meet together in the temple courts. They broke bread in their homes and ate together with glad and sincere hearts,
        </p>
        <p>
          <sup>47</sup> praising God and enjoying the favor of all the people. And the Lord added to their number daily those who were being saved.
        </p>
