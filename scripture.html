            <sup>1</sup> When the people saw that Moses was so long in coming down from the mountain, they
            gathered around Aaron and said, “Come, make us gods who will go before us. As for this
            fellow Moses who brought us up out of Egypt, we don’t know what has happened to him.”
        </p>
        <p>
            <sup>2</sup> Aaron answered them, “Take off the gold earrings that your wives, your sons and your
            daughters are wearing, and bring them to me.”
        </p>
        <p>
            <sup>3</sup> So all the people took off their earrings and
            brought them to Aaron.
        </p>
        <p>
            <sup>4</sup> He took what they handed him and made it into an idol cast in the shape of a calf,
            fashioning it with a tool. Then they said, “These are your gods, Israel, who brought you up
            out of Egypt.”
        </p>
        <p>
            <sup>5</sup> When Aaron saw this, he built an altar in front of the calf and announced,
            “Tomorrow there will be a festival to the Lord.”
        </p>
        <p>
            <sup>6</sup> So the next day the people rose early and
            sacrificed burnt offerings and presented fellowship offerings. Afterward they sat down to eat
            and drink and got up to indulge in revelry.
