        <p><b>Acts 8:29-38</b></p>
        <p>
          <sup>29</sup> The Spirit told Philip, “Go to that chariot and stay near it.”
        </p>
        <p>
          <sup>30</sup> Then Philip ran up to the chariot and heard the man reading Isaiah the prophet. “Do you understand what you are reading?” Philip asked.
        </p>
        <p>
          <sup>31</sup> “How can I,” he said, “unless someone explains it to me?” So he invited Philip to come up and sit with him.
        </p>
        <p>
          <sup>32</sup> This is the passage of Scripture the eunuch was reading:

          “He was led like a sheep to the slaughter,
              and as a lamb before its shearer is silent,
              so he did not open his mouth.
        </p>
        <p>
          <sup>33</sup> In his humiliation he was deprived of justice.
          Who can speak of his descendants?
          For his life was taken from the earth.”
        </p>
        <p>
          <sup>34</sup> The eunuch asked Philip, “Tell me, please, who is the prophet talking about, himself or someone else?” 
        </p>
        <p>
          <sup>35</sup> Then Philip began with that very passage of Scripture and told him the good news about Jesus.
        </p>
        <p>
          <sup>36</sup> As they traveled along the road, they came to some water and the eunuch said, “Look, here is water. What can stand in the way of my being baptized?”
        </p>
        <p>
          <sup>37</sup> *Philip said, “If you believe with all your heart, you may.” The eunuch answered, “I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God.”
        </p>
        <p>
          <sup>38</sup> And he gave orders to stop the chariot. Then both Philip and the eunuch went down into the water and Philip baptized him.
        </p>
