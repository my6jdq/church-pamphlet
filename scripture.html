        <p>
            <sup>1</sup> When the day of Pentecost came, they were all together in one place.
        </p>
        <p>
          <sup>2</sup> Suddenly a sound like the blowing of a violent wind came from heaven and filled the whole house where they were sitting.
        </p>
        <p>
          <sup>3</sup> They saw what seemed to be tongues of fire that separated and came to rest on each of them.
        </p>
        <p>
          <sup>4</sup> All of them were filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak in other tongues as the Spirit enabled them.
        </p>
        <p>
          <sup>5</sup> Now there were staying in Jerusalem God-fearing Jews from every nation under heaven.
        </p>
        <p>
          <sup>6</sup> When they heard this sound, a crowd came together in bewilderment, because each one heard their own language being spoken.
        </p>
        <p>
          <sup>7</sup> Utterly amazed, they asked: “Aren’t all these who are speaking Galileans?
        </p>
        <p>
          <sup>8</sup> Then how is it that each of us hears them in our native language?
        </p>
        <p>
          <sup>9</sup> Parthians, Medes and Elamites; residents of Mesopotamia, Judea and Cappadocia, Pontus and Asia,
        </p>
        <p>
          <sup>10</sup> Phrygia and Pamphylia, Egypt and the parts of Libya near Cyrene; visitors from Rome
        </p>
        <p>
          <sup>11</sup> (both Jews and converts to Judaism); Cretans and Arabs—we hear them declaring the wonders of God in our own tongues!”
        </p>
        <p>
          <sup>12</sup> Amazed and perplexed, they asked one another, “What does this mean?”
        </p>
        <p>
          <sup>13</sup> Some, however, made fun of them and said, “They have had too much wine.”
        </p>
