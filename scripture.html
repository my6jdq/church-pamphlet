      <h2>Scripture</h2>
      <p>Acts 4:1-13(NIV)</p>
      <section class="scripture">
        <hr>
        <p><b></b></p>
        <p>
          <sup>1</sup> The priests and the captain of the temple guard and the Sadducees came up to Peter and John while they were speaking to the people.
        </p>
        <p>
          <sup>2</sup> They were greatly disturbed because the apostles were teaching the people, proclaiming in Jesus the resurrection of the dead. 
        </p>
        <p>
          <sup>3</sup> They seized Peter and John and, because it was evening, they put them in jail until the next day.
        </p>
        <p>
          <sup>4</sup> But many who heard the message believed; so the number of men who believed grew to about five thousand.
        </p>
        <p>
          <sup>5</sup> The next day the rulers, the elders and the teachers of the law met in Jerusalem. 
        </p>
        <p>
          <sup>6</sup> Annas the high priest was there, and so were Caiaphas, John, Alexander and others of the high priest’s family.
        </p>
        <p>
          <sup>7</sup> They had Peter and John brought before them and began to question them: “By what power or what name did you do this?”
        </p>
        <p>
          <sup>8</sup> Then Peter, filled with the Holy Spirit, said to them: “Rulers and elders of the people!
        </p>
        <p>
          <sup>9</sup> If we are being called to account today for an act of kindness shown to a man who was lame and are being asked how he was healed, 
        </p>
        <p>
          <sup>10</sup> then know this, you and all the people of Israel: It is by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom you crucified but whom God raised from the dead, that this man stands before you healed. 
        </p>
        <p>
          <sup>11</sup> Jesus is

          “‘the stone you builders rejected,
              which has become the cornerstone.’
        </p>
        <p>
          <sup>12</sup> Salvation is found in no one else, for there is no other name under heaven given to mankind by which we must be saved.”
        </p>
        <p>
          <sup>13</sup> When they saw the courage of Peter and John and realized that they were unschooled, ordinary men, they were astonished and they took note that these men had been with Jesus.
