          <sup>14</sup> But since they could see the man who had been healed standing there with them, there was nothing they could say.
        </p>
        <p>
          <sup>15</sup> So they ordered them to withdraw from the Sanhedrin and then conferred together.
        </p>
        <p>
          <sup>16</sup> “What are we going to do with these men?” they asked. “Everyone living in Jerusalem knows they have performed a notable sign, and we cannot deny it.
        </p>
        <p>
          <sup>17</sup> But to stop this thing from spreading any further among the people, we must warn them to speak no longer to anyone in this name.”
        </p>
        <p>
          <sup>18</sup> Then they called them in again and commanded them not to speak or teach at all in the name of Jesus.
        </p>
        <p>
          <sup>19</sup> But Peter and John replied, “Which is right in God’s eyes: to listen to you, or to him? You be the judges!
        </p>
        <p>
          <sup>20</sup> As for us, we cannot help speaking about what we have seen and heard.”
        </p>
        <p>
          <sup>21</sup> After further threats they let them go. They could not decide how to punish them, because all the people were praising God for what had happened. 
        </p>
        <p>
          <sup>22</sup> For the man who was miraculously healed was over forty years old.
