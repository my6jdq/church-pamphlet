      <h2>Scripture</h2>
      <p>1 Samuel 17:50-53(NIV)</p>
      <section class="scripture">
        <p>
            <sup>50</sup> So David triumphed over the Philistine with a sling 
            and a stone; without a sword in his hand he struck down the Philistine 
            and killed him.
          </p>
          <p>
            <sup>51</sup> David ran and stood over him. He took hold of the 
            Philistine’s sword and drew it from the sheath. After he killed him, 
            he cut off his head with the sword. When the Philistines saw that 
            their hero was dead, they turned and ran. 
        </p>
        <p>
          <sup>52</sup> Then the men of Israel and Judah surged forward 
          with a shout and pursued the Philistines to the entrance of Gath[f] 
          and to the gates of Ekron. 
          Their dead were strewn along the Shaaraim road to Gath and Ekron.
      </p>
      <p>
        <sup>53</sup> When the Israelites returned from chasing the Philistines, 
        they plundered their camp.
    </p>
    <hr>
    <p>Matthew 28:16(NIV)</p>
      <section class="scripture">
        <p>
            <sup>16</sup> You can be sure that I will be with you always. 
            I will continue with you until the end of the world.
          </p>
      </section>
      <hr>
      <p>Psalm 16:7-9(NIV)</p>
      <section class="scripture">
        <p>
          <sup>7</sup> I will praise the Lord, who counsels me;
          even at night my heart instructs me.
        </p>
        <p>
            <sup>8</sup> I keep my eyes always on the Lord.
            With him at my right hand, I will not be shaken.
          </p>
          <p>
            <sup>9</sup> Therefore my heart is glad and my tongue rejoices;
            my body also will rest secure,
          </p>
      </section>
      
      <p>  
        <!-- <sup>25</sup> In the same way, after supper he took the cup, saying, 
        “This cup is the new covenant in my blood; do this, 
        whenever you drink it, in remembrance of me.”
      </p>
      <p>
        <sup>26</sup> For whenever you eat this bread and drink this cup, 
        you proclaim the Lord’s death until he comes. -->
      </p>
      <!-- <p>
        <sup>33</sup>
      </p> -->
      <!-- <hr>
      <p>
        <sup>33</sup> So then, my brothers and sisters, 
        when you gather to eat, you should all eat together.
      </p>
      <p>
        <sup>34</sup> Anyone who is hungry should eat something at home, 
        so that when you meet together it may not result in judgment.
